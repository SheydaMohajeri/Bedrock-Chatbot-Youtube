Then the\\u003c\\u002fbr\\u003echaracter pulled out their phone, finally having reception,\\u003c\\u002fbr\\u003eand spoke with their mum. I don't remember what they spoke\\u003c\\u002fbr\\u003eabout but it was a heartfelt moment. I felt both responsible\\u003c\\u002fbr\\u003efor providing my character this experience while\\u003c\\u002fbr\\u003esimultaneously sharing the experience with the character. It\\u003c\\u002fbr\\u003ewas a mix of emotions from pride in myself for having\\u003c\\u002fbr\\u003eovercome the primary obstacle of the game, to empathy for\\u003c\\u002fbr\\u003ethe character as they share a candid and vulnerable moment\\u003c\\u002fbr\\u003ewith a loved one. In combination with the breathtaking\\u003c\\u002fbr\\u003evisuals it was an incredibly wholesome end that left me\\u003c\\u002fbr\\u003esatisfied with the whole experience.\",\"I was able to feel the emotions portrayed as much as the\\u003c\\u002fbr\\u003echaracters did.

Just after starting the game I was\\u003c\\u002fbr\\u003egreeted by an UI which was well crafted to combine\\u003c\\u002fbr\\u003efunctionality with design around the theme of the game.\\u003c\\u002fbr\\u003eDuring the loading screen which was an artwork there was a\\u003c\\u002fbr\\u003eshort bit of narrated information like you would find in a\\u003c\\u002fbr\\u003emuseum about Chinese history.   Then I was thrown onto an\\u003c\\u002fbr\\u003eartistic map of china with many details and sights.

For times\\u003c\\u002fbr\\u003esake, I'll narrow it down to a specific quest. (though I\\u003c\\u002fbr\\u003elove so many, and reccomend this game to everyone interested\\u003c\\u002fbr\\u003ein a modern day story based of legends myths and\\u003c\\u002fbr\\u003econspiracies being real). In this quest, an incredibly smart\\u003c\\u002fbr\\u003e8 year old (with telepathic powers, who is one of the last\\u003c\\u002fbr\\u003esurvivors of an apocolypse esque scenario) leads you through\\u003c\\u002fbr\\u003eCarl Jung's theory of the shared subconscious. To do this,\\u003c\\u002fbr\\u003eyou fall asleep in a daycare and roam around a dream. You\\u003c\\u002fbr\\u003estart by picking out of three words, which best describes\\u003c\\u002fbr\\u003eyou. Brave, kind, wise, or creative. You then spell the\\u003c\\u002fbr\\u003eopposite.

The answers you gave result in\\u003c\\u002fbr\\u003edifferent buffs. Having parents is a heal overtime, being\\u003c\\u002fbr\\u003ealone is a damage buff. A fight ensues, but once you think\\u003c\\u002fbr\\u003eyou've won, your shadow grows tenfold and chases you back to\\u003c\\u002fbr\\u003ethe start of the path. The only way out is to evade your\\u003c\\u002fbr\\u003eshadow and wake yourself up.

Instead it leaves\\u003c\\u002fbr\\u003elittle clues, lore tablets, pieces of dialogue, or\\u003c\\u002fbr\\u003echaracters to tell bits and pieces of the story. Once you\\u003c\\u002fbr\\u003estart figuring out what's going on, you can't stop thinking\\u003c\\u002fbr\\u003eabout it or trying to find out more.

Children are\\u003c\\u002fbr\\u003esacrificed to become void creatures in order to contain the\\u003c\\u002fbr\\u003eRadiance, a deadly infection that would wipe out this whole\\u003c\\u002fbr\\u003eworld if left to spread.

I felt that the game very\\u003c\\u002fbr\\u003eprofoundly captured the experience of living in a small\\u003c\\u002fbr\\u003eprovincial town without prospects, and that the game as a\\u003c\\u002fbr\\u003ewhole, in its mechanics, its narrative, its visuals,\\u003c\\u002fbr\\u003ecombined to capture and express this, and then to transform\\u003c\\u002fbr\\u003ethis into an object of reflection. The game is simple in its\\u003c\\u002fbr\\u003evisuals and mechanics, but these are well tailored to create\\u003c\\u002fbr\\u003ean experience: the light platforming and movement mechanics\\u003c\\u002fbr\\u003ehelped me to physically identify with the main character,\\u003c\\u002fbr\\u003eand encouraged me to explore the town and know people. And\\u003c\\u002fbr\\u003ethe experience of this was of aimlessly going for a walk\\u003c\\u002fbr\\u003elike I would have in my own home town. I think this physical\\u003c\\u002fbr\\u003eidentification helped create space for a psychological\\u003c\\u002fbr\\u003eidentification with a complex and troubled character,\\u003c\\u002fbr\\u003emeaning that narrative choices felt weighty. In\\u003c\\u002fbr\\u003econversations with \\\"my\\\" family I wanted to make them happy,\\u003c\\u002fbr\\u003ebut also felt the tension between this and living as\\u003c\\u002fbr\\u003e\\\"myself\\\" in this town, under these emotionally difficult\\u003c\\u002fbr\\u003econditions.  The choices in the game are all about building\\u003c\\u002fbr\\u003eand maintaining relationships, developing and maintaining\\u003c\\u002fbr\\u003eyour identity - they do not affect your \\\"progress\\\"  or\\u003c\\u002fbr\\u003eachievements as such - this captures something fundamental\\u003c\\u002fbr\\u003eabout daily life I think - most of our choices are like\\u003c\\u002fbr\\u003ethis. Again the game aestheticises and transforms this\\u003c\\u002fbr\\u003efeature of life to make it an object of reflection.\\u003c\\u002fbr\\u003eWhen playing the game I thought a lot about relatively early\\u003c\\u002fbr\\u003ecinema and the way it was creating a language for itself,\\u003c\\u002fbr\\u003eand about how exciting some of the moments of discovery and\\u003c\\u002fbr\\u003ecreation, and creative overreach in those films can be.\\u003c\\u002fbr\\u003eThere were some genuinely electrifying moments in the game\\u003c\\u002fbr\\u003ewhere I could see a distinct language for games being\\u003c\\u002fbr\\u003ecreated in a similar way. In this case a language of agency\\u003c\\u002fbr\\u003eand constraint: the game uses this inherent tension in the\\u003c\\u002fbr\\u003emedium of gaming to dramatise experience of trappedness,\\u003c\\u002fbr\\u003eillusions about our own agency, and the consequences of\\u003c\\u002fbr\\u003eseemingly minor decisions.   The light platforming and\\u003c\\u002fbr\\u003eexploration element is again important in this - it brings\\u003c\\u002fbr\\u003ean element of freedom and agency into an otherwise quite\\u003c\\u002fbr\\u003escripted genre (effectively point and click narrative\\u003c\\u002fbr\\u003eadventures) and this sets up a really effective tension\\u003c\\u002fbr\\u003ebetween freedom and narrative constraint. A fairly simple\\u003c\\u002fbr\\u003egame mechanic is introduced in a way that supports and\\u003c\\u002fbr\\u003eexpresses the themes and experience of the art.  There is a\\u003c\\u002fbr\\u003escene at a party which captures this well - the character\\u003c\\u002fbr\\u003edoes not want to drink - she is nervous of the party and\\u003c\\u002fbr\\u003enervous of her own behaviour if she drinks too much. But you\\u003c\\u002fbr\\u003ecan only progress through the scene by drinking.  If you do\\u003c\\u002fbr\\u003enot drink you run out of interactions and ways to pass time\\u003c\\u002fbr\\u003e- you have been away from these people for years, feel\\u003c\\u002fbr\\u003ealienated from the town and constrained by your past\\u003c\\u002fbr\\u003ebehaviour with them, and have few comfortable topics of\\u003c\\u002fbr\\u003econversation. There is a genuine sense of anxiety in not\\u003c\\u002fbr\\u003ewanting to go back and get another drink, combined with the\\u003c\\u002fbr\\u003eknowledge that that is what you're going to do. Though this\\u003c\\u002fbr\\u003eis a simple thing, the ground (in identifying with the\\u003c\\u002fbr\\u003echaracter, creating a world) is laid so well, and the scene\\u003c\\u002fbr\\u003ewritten so convincingly that the effect of these forced\\u003c\\u002fbr\\u003echoices lands very strongly. Without the sense of freedom in\\u003c\\u002fbr\\u003ethe game this might have been tedious and limiting. I can't\\u003c\\u002fbr\\u003ethink of another work of art which captures the experience\\u003c\\u002fbr\\u003eof being (banally) constrained by your own nature so well.\\u003c\\u002fbr\\u003eThe scene plays out with an inevitability which is sad and\\u003c\\u002fbr\\u003efamiliar, but aestheticised and distanced by gaming\\u003c\\u002fbr\\u003econventions. The medium and the subject are combined here in\\u003c\\u002fbr\\u003ea way that could not happen in other narrative forms. And\\u003c\\u002fbr\\u003emost interestingly it leverages features of gaming which\\u003c\\u002fbr\\u003esome have argued make it a poor medium for narrative. It is\\u003c\\u002fbr\\u003ea small part of the game, and a simple idea, but it works\\u003c\\u002fbr\\u003ewith the materiality and constraints of gaming as a medium,\\u003c\\u002fbr\\u003eto articulate an experience quite forcefully.\",\"at the end of the true (fifth) ending, the ending credits\\u003c\\u002fbr\\u003esong flows between english, french, and japanese, and slowly\\u003c\\u002fbr\\u003efades out as a loud hum of people takes the melody, and it\\u003c\\u002fbr\\u003ewas perhaps the last of many times the game struck me as\\u003c\\u002fbr\\u003eart, as it so perfectly closes a game that so perfectly\\u003c\\u002fbr\\u003eimposes and explores questions of human nature in a game\\u003c\\u002fbr\\u003ewith no humans\",\"It was breathtaking to see what a digital playground can\\u003c\\u002fbr\\u003elook like.\",\"The game had a simple linear story structure that allowed\\u003c\\u002fbr\\u003eyou to experience and understand elements of the story at\\u003c\\u002fbr\\u003eyour own pace as you play through the game.

The game's controls are\\u003c\\u002fbr\\u003every simple (there is one small choice at the end but\\u003c\\u002fbr\\u003eotherwise the player can only move the player character\\u003c\\u002fbr\\u003earound and occasionally interact with pieces of the set),\\u003c\\u002fbr\\u003ebut the art is in a charming, nostalgic sort of 8bit style,\\u003c\\u002fbr\\u003eand the writing is incredibly evocative. The unnamed player\\u003c\\u002fbr\\u003echaracter's narration is a letter to a (likewise unnamed)\\u003c\\u002fbr\\u003eperson they miss; the player character walks this audience\\u003c\\u002fbr\\u003ethrough daily life on the ship (including drinking coffee,\\u003c\\u002fbr\\u003etending plants, and controlling the ship), then goes to a\\u003c\\u002fbr\\u003ehologram room, recreates the last memory of the time the two\\u003c\\u002fbr\\u003einteracted, and discusses the parts of the memory they are\\u003c\\u002fbr\\u003eno longer sure of while the hologram degrades.

A fight ensues, but once you think\\u003c\\u002fbr\\u003eyou've won, your shadow grows tenfold and chases you back to\\u003c\\u002fbr\\u003ethe start of the path. The only way out is to evade your\\u003c\\u002fbr\\u003eshadow and wake yourself up. Personally, I believe its\\u003c\\u002fbr\\u003econveying the idea that ultimately, the only way to defeat\\u003c\\u002fbr\\u003ethe darker side of yourself is to acknowledge all that you\\u003c\\u002fbr\\u003eare and use that to defeat all of what eats at you from the\\u003c\\u002fbr\\u003einside, and even then, some simple avoidance may be needed\\u003c\\u002fbr\\u003eto maintain your day to day composure.

And\\u003c\\u002fbr\\u003ethe experience of this was of aimlessly going for a walk\\u003c\\u002fbr\\u003elike I would have in my own home town. I think this physical\\u003c\\u002fbr\\u003eidentification helped create space for a psychological\\u003c\\u002fbr\\u003eidentification with a complex and troubled character,\\u003c\\u002fbr\\u003emeaning that narrative choices felt weighty. In\\u003c\\u002fbr\\u003econversations with \\\"my\\\" family I wanted to make them happy,\\u003c\\u002fbr\\u003ebut also felt the tension between this and living as\\u003c\\u002fbr\\u003e\\\"myself\\\" in this town, under these emotionally difficult\\u003c\\u002fbr\\u003econditions.  The choices in the game are all about building\\u003c\\u002fbr\\u003eand maintaining relationships, developing and maintaining\\u003c\\u002fbr\\u003eyour identity - they do not affect your \\\"progress\\\"  or\\u003c\\u002fbr\\u003eachievements as such - this captures something fundamental\\u003c\\u002fbr\\u003eabout daily life I think - most of our choices are like\\u003c\\u002fbr\\u003ethis. Again the game aestheticises and transforms this\\u003c\\u002fbr\\u003efeature of life to make it an object of reflection.\\u003c\\u002fbr\\u003eWhen playing the game I thought a lot about relatively early\\u003c\\u002fbr\\u003ecinema and the way it was creating a language for itself,\\u003c\\u002fbr\\u003eand about how exciting some of the moments of discovery and\\u003c\\u002fbr\\u003ecreation, and creative overreach in those films can be.\\u003c\\u002fbr\\u003eThere were some genuinely electrifying moments in the game\\u003c\\u002fbr\\u003ewhere I could see a distinct language for games being\\u003c\\u002fbr\\u003ecreated in a similar way. In this case a language of agency\\u003c\\u002fbr\\u003eand constraint: the game uses this inherent tension in the\\u003c\\u002fbr\\u003emedium of gaming to dramatise experience of trappedness,\\u003c\\u002fbr\\u003eillusions about our own agency, and the consequences of\\u003c\\u002fbr\\u003eseemingly minor decisions.   The light platforming and\\u003c\\u002fbr\\u003eexploration element is again important in this - it brings\\u003c\\u002fbr\\u003ean element of freedom and agency into an otherwise quite\\u003c\\u002fbr\\u003escripted genre (effectively point and click narrative\\u003c\\u002fbr\\u003eadventures) and this sets up a really effective tension\\u003c\\u002fbr\\u003ebetween freedom and narrative constraint. A fairly simple\\u003c\\u002fbr\\u003egame mechanic is introduced in a way that supports and\\u003c\\u002fbr\\u003eexpresses the themes and experience of the art.  There is a\\u003c\\u002fbr\\u003escene at a party which captures this well - the character\\u003c\\u002fbr\\u003edoes not want to drink - she is nervous of the party and\\u003c\\u002fbr\\u003enervous of her own behaviour if she drinks too much. But you\\u003c\\u002fbr\\u003ecan only progress through the scene by drinking.  If you do\\u003c\\u002fbr\\u003enot drink you run out of interactions and ways to pass time\\u003c\\u002fbr\\u003e- you have been away from these people for years, feel\\u003c\\u002fbr\\u003ealienated from the town and constrained by your past\\u003c\\u002fbr\\u003ebehaviour with them, and have few comfortable topics of\\u003c\\u002fbr\\u003econversation. There is a genuine sense of anxiety in not\\u003c\\u002fbr\\u003ewanting to go back and get another drink, combined with the\\u003c\\u002fbr\\u003eknowledge that that is what you're going to do. Though this\\u003c\\u002fbr\\u003eis a simple thing, the ground (in identifying with the\\u003c\\u002fbr\\u003echaracter, creating a world) is laid so well, and the scene\\u003c\\u002fbr\\u003ewritten so convincingly that the effect of these forced\\u003c\\u002fbr\\u003echoices lands very strongly. Without the sense of freedom in\\u003c\\u002fbr\\u003ethe game this might have been tedious and limiting. I can't\\u003c\\u002fbr\\u003ethink of another work of art which captures the experience\\u003c\\u002fbr\\u003eof being (banally) constrained by your own nature so well.\\u003c\\u002fbr\\u003eThe scene plays out with an inevitability which is sad and\\u003c\\u002fbr\\u003efamiliar, but aestheticised and distanced by gaming\\u003c\\u002fbr\\u003econventions. The medium and the subject are combined here in\\u003c\\u002fbr\\u003ea way that could not happen in other narrative forms. And\\u003c\\u002fbr\\u003emost interestingly it leverages features of gaming which\\u003c\\u002fbr\\u003esome have argued make it a poor medium for narrative. It is\\u003c\\u002fbr\\u003ea small part of the game, and a simple idea, but it works\\u003c\\u002fbr\\u003ewith the materiality and constraints of gaming as a medium,\\u003c\\u002fbr\\u003eto articulate an experience quite forcefully.\",\"at the end of the true (fifth) ending, the ending credits\\u003c\\u002fbr\\u003esong flows between english, french, and japanese, and slowly\\u003c\\u002fbr\\u003efades out as a loud hum of people takes the melody, and it\\u003c\\u002fbr\\u003ewas perhaps the last of many times the game struck me as\\u003c\\u002fbr\\u003eart, as it so perfectly closes a game that so perfectly\\u003c\\u002fbr\\u003eimposes and explores questions of human nature in a game\\u003c\\u002fbr\\u003ewith no humans\",\"It was breathtaking to see what a digital playground can\\u003c\\u002fbr\\u003elook like.\",\"The game had a simple linear story structure that allowed\\u003c\\u002fbr\\u003eyou to experience and understand elements of the story at\\u003c\\u002fbr\\u003eyour own pace as you play through the game.

The game's controls are\\u003c\\u002fbr\\u003every simple (there is one small choice at the end but\\u003c\\u002fbr\\u003eotherwise the player can only move the player character\\u003c\\u002fbr\\u003earound and occasionally interact with pieces of the set),\\u003c\\u002fbr\\u003ebut the art is in a charming, nostalgic sort of 8bit style,\\u003c\\u002fbr\\u003eand the writing is incredibly evocative. The unnamed player\\u003c\\u002fbr\\u003echaracter's narration is a letter to a (likewise unnamed)\\u003c\\u002fbr\\u003eperson they miss; the player character walks this audience\\u003c\\u002fbr\\u003ethrough daily life on the ship (including drinking coffee,\\u003c\\u002fbr\\u003etending plants, and controlling the ship), then goes to a\\u003c\\u002fbr\\u003ehologram room, recreates the last memory of the time the two\\u003c\\u002fbr\\u003einteracted, and discusses the parts of the memory they are\\u003c\\u002fbr\\u003eno longer sure of while the hologram degrades.

After\\u003c\\u002fbr\\u003eplaying the game I immediately recommended it to some\\u003c\\u002fbr\\u003efriends, telling them that the experience of playing it felt\\u003c\\u002fbr\\u003elike the experience of reading a poem.\",\"Last game as art I played was Gris. It's a high artistic\\u003c\\u002fbr\\u003egame, where you explore with the character a world.

Basically, for each state of emotion, the\\u003c\\u002fbr\\u003eworld was modified around you, transforming elements already\\u003c\\u002fbr\\u003esaw.

One of a\\u003c\\u002fbr\\u003eshocking clarity.\",\"The game starts with the protagonist narrating his history\\u003c\\u002fbr\\u003ewithin the universe and detailing the main events of the\\u003c\\u002fbr\\u003eprevious game, already the slides presented show comic book\\u003c\\u002fbr\\u003estyle panels with interactive bits to shape they way the\\u003c\\u002fbr\\u003efirst game happened in a streamlined way. Afterwards you're\\u003c\\u002fbr\\u003eshown a cutscene showing the Normandy, your ship being\\u003c\\u002fbr\\u003eattacked by an unknown vessel of uniquely alien design\\u003c\\u002fbr\\u003eresembling a sort of wasp hive built around a massive laser\\u003c\\u002fbr\\u003ebeam canon. The Normandy and it's crew are in grave peril\\u003c\\u002fbr\\u003ewith everyone scrambling to make repairs, bark out orders,\\u003c\\u002fbr\\u003eor get to the escape pods. You are then moved to your\\u003c\\u002fbr\\u003echaracter, Commander Shepard, a calm and steady leader whose\\u003c\\u002fbr\\u003eface you cannot see behind his military grade space suit.\\u003c\\u002fbr\\u003eWhile you make your way to the bridge to retrieve the pilot\\u003c\\u002fbr\\u003eof the Normandy you see flames and pylons scarrtered\\u003c\\u002fbr\\u003ethroughout the ship leading up to the cock pit. As you enter\\u003c\\u002fbr\\u003ethe CIC (Combat Information Center, the place you used to\\u003c\\u002fbr\\u003enavigate your ship through the galaxy) you are met with an\\u003c\\u002fbr\\u003eimmediate contrast to the blaringly loud, creaking, flaming\\u003c\\u002fbr\\u003eship into the silent vacuum of space. The entire ceiling has\\u003c\\u002fbr\\u003ebeen ripped off, the artificial gravity isn't working in\\u003c\\u002fbr\\u003ethis section and you walk at almost a snails pace across to\\u003c\\u002fbr\\u003ethe cockpit. The only sounds you can hear are your own\\u003c\\u002fbr\\u003ebreathing through your helmet and the ship gets almost\\u003c\\u002fbr\\u003ecompletely dark until you emerge at the other end finding\\u003c\\u002fbr\\u003ethe pilot. You convince him that the Normandy is gone and\\u003c\\u002fbr\\u003ethere's nothing he can do and safely get him to the last\\u003c\\u002fbr\\u003eescape pod but you're not so lucky.

It had a consistent art\\u003c\\u002fbr\\u003estyle across all sections, but varied in color palette and\\u003c\\u002fbr\\u003emood. This game is like walking through someone's diary\\u003c\\u002fbr\\u003ecombined with looking at a photo album.

Gorgeous\\u003c\\u002fbr\\u003ecolors. Every moment a potential still that could be its own\\u003c\\u002fbr\\u003epiece of art. The emotional impact of the game was tangible\\u003c\\u002fbr\\u003ein the years I experienced at the end. The story within was\\u003c\\u002fbr\\u003egleaned through context clues and careful inspection. The\\u003c\\u002fbr\\u003ecamerawork, the careful curation of progression.

Undertale\\u003c\\u002fbr\\u003edoes this: the game plays out in a way that recommends you\\u003c\\u002fbr\\u003enot kill anybody, and doing so gives you a genuinely\\u003c\\u002fbr\\u003eheartwarming story. It was also marketed specifically as a\\u003c\\u002fbr\\u003egame where you don't need to kill anyone. But because you\\u003c\\u002fbr\\u003ecan play it multiple times, you could also do the inverse:\\u003c\\u002fbr\\u003ekill EVERYONE. It invokes a dissonance in the player that\\u003c\\u002fbr\\u003eonly a game could create: you've come to love all these\\u003c\\u002fbr\\u003echaracters, and now you want to see what happens when you\\u003c\\u002fbr\\u003epersonally kill them all. And you have to really try to do\\u003c\\u002fbr\\u003eit: the game forces you to grind out kills, and throws two\\u003c\\u002fbr\\u003eincredibly difficult bosses at you (one which explicitly\\u003c\\u002fbr\\u003echeats). There are moments where the game points out that\\u003c\\u002fbr\\u003eyou, THE PLAYER, are making these choices. The most poignant\\u003c\\u002fbr\\u003eof these is once you've finished: you're PERMANENTLY\\u003c\\u002fbr\\u003epunished for doing the deed; if you do another Pacifist\\u003c\\u002fbr\\u003eroute, the heartwarming scene at the end instead concludes\\u003c\\u002fbr\\u003ewith a stinger and a brief but telltale appearance of the\\u003c\\u002fbr\\u003emonster you created in the genocide route.\",\"While not a singular occurrence, the closest I have ever\\u003c\\u002fbr\\u003ecome to experiencing game as art was during the end of the\\u003c\\u002fbr\\u003efirst Bioshock game, where there is a plot twist that\\u003c\\u002fbr\\u003etriggered for me an entire rethinking of the gaming\\u003c\\u002fbr\\u003eindustry. It was the first time I felt that a game narrative\\u003c\\u002fbr\\u003ecould make a case for digital game as art. It was very well\\u003c\\u002fbr\\u003ethought-out and carefully driven throughout the game play\\u003c\\u002fbr\\u003eexperience and I still think it makes a powerful statement\\u003c\\u002fbr\\u003eon the superior artistic syncretism that games can provide.\",\"Well the video game was centred on the question “what makes\\u003c\\u002fbr\\u003eus human” and the game had a lot of philosophy, and even\\u003c\\u002fbr\\u003esome of the characters had famous philosophers names.

After losing, Satan will allow\\u003c\\u002fbr\\u003eyou to re-try, and after multiple attempts, I defeated Satan\\u003c\\u002fbr\\u003eand felt good about having beaten the game, and after seeing\\u003c\\u002fbr\\u003ethe other citizens of Hell react to how I had enabled\\u003c\\u002fbr\\u003eSatan’s self-destructive behaviour, I started to wonder if I\\u003c\\u002fbr\\u003ehad done the right and just thing.

Instead it leaves\\u003c\\u002fbr\\u003elittle clues, lore tablets, pieces of dialogue, or\\u003c\\u002fbr\\u003echaracters to tell bits and pieces of the story.

I felt that the game very\\u003c\\u002fbr\\u003eprofoundly captured the experience of living in a small\\u003c\\u002fbr\\u003eprovincial town without prospects, and that the game as a\\u003c\\u002fbr\\u003ewhole, in its mechanics, its narrative, its visuals,\\u003c\\u002fbr\\u003ecombined to capture and express this, and then to transform\\u003c\\u002fbr\\u003ethis into an object of reflection. The game is simple in its\\u003c\\u002fbr\\u003evisuals and mechanics, but these are well tailored to create\\u003c\\u002fbr\\u003ean experience: the light platforming and movement mechanics\\u003c\\u002fbr\\u003ehelped me to physically identify with the main character,\\u003c\\u002fbr\\u003eand encouraged me to explore the town and know people. And\\u003c\\u002fbr\\u003ethe experience of this was of aimlessly going for a walk\\u003c\\u002fbr\\u003elike I would have in my own home town. I think this physical\\u003c\\u002fbr\\u003eidentification helped create space for a psychological\\u003c\\u002fbr\\u003eidentification with a complex and troubled character,\\u003c\\u002fbr\\u003emeaning that narrative choices felt weighty. In\\u003c\\u002fbr\\u003econversations with \\\"my\\\" family I wanted to make them happy,\\u003c\\u002fbr\\u003ebut also felt the tension between this and living as\\u003c\\u002fbr\\u003e\\\"myself\\\" in this town, under these emotionally difficult\\u003c\\u002fbr\\u003econditions.  The choices in the game are all about building\\u003c\\u002fbr\\u003eand maintaining relationships, developing and maintaining\\u003c\\u002fbr\\u003eyour identity - they do not affect your \\\"progress\\\"  or\\u003c\\u002fbr\\u003eachievements as such - this captures something fundamental\\u003c\\u002fbr\\u003eabout daily life I think - most of our choices are like\\u003c\\u002fbr\\u003ethis. Again the game aestheticises and transforms this\\u003c\\u002fbr\\u003efeature of life to make it an object of reflection.\\u003c\\u002fbr\\u003eWhen playing the game I thought a lot about relatively early\\u003c\\u002fbr\\u003ecinema and the way it was creating a language for itself,\\u003c\\u002fbr\\u003eand about how exciting some of the moments of discovery and\\u003c\\u002fbr\\u003ecreation, and creative overreach in those films can be.\\u003c\\u002fbr\\u003eThere were some genuinely electrifying moments in the game\\u003c\\u002fbr\\u003ewhere I could see a distinct language for games being\\u003c\\u002fbr\\u003ecreated in a similar way. In this case a language of agency\\u003c\\u002fbr\\u003eand constraint: the game uses this inherent tension in the\\u003c\\u002fbr\\u003emedium of gaming to dramatise experience of trappedness,\\u003c\\u002fbr\\u003eillusions about our own agency, and the consequences of\\u003c\\u002fbr\\u003eseemingly minor decisions.   The light platforming and\\u003c\\u002fbr\\u003eexploration element is again important in this - it brings\\u003c\\u002fbr\\u003ean element of freedom and agency into an otherwise quite\\u003c\\u002fbr\\u003escripted genre (effectively point and click narrative\\u003c\\u002fbr\\u003eadventures) and this sets up a really effective tension\\u003c\\u002fbr\\u003ebetween freedom and narrative constraint. A fairly simple\\u003c\\u002fbr\\u003egame mechanic is introduced in a way that supports and\\u003c\\u002fbr\\u003eexpresses the themes and experience of the art.  There is a\\u003c\\u002fbr\\u003escene at a party which captures this well - the character\\u003c\\u002fbr\\u003edoes not want to drink - she is nervous of the party and\\u003c\\u002fbr\\u003enervous of her own behaviour if she drinks too much. But you\\u003c\\u002fbr\\u003ecan only progress through the scene by drinking.  If you do\\u003c\\u002fbr\\u003enot drink you run out of interactions and ways to pass time\\u003c\\u002fbr\\u003e- you have been away from these people for years, feel\\u003c\\u002fbr\\u003ealienated from the town and constrained by your past\\u003c\\u002fbr\\u003ebehaviour with them, and have few comfortable topics of\\u003c\\u002fbr\\u003econversation. There is a genuine sense of anxiety in not\\u003c\\u002fbr\\u003ewanting to go back and get another drink, combined with the\\u003c\\u002fbr\\u003eknowledge that that is what you're going to do. Though this\\u003c\\u002fbr\\u003eis a simple thing, the ground (in identifying with the\\u003c\\u002fbr\\u003echaracter, creating a world) is laid so well, and the scene\\u003c\\u002fbr\\u003ewritten so convincingly that the effect of these forced\\u003c\\u002fbr\\u003echoices lands very strongly. Without the sense of freedom in\\u003c\\u002fbr\\u003ethe game this might have been tedious and limiting. I can't\\u003c\\u002fbr\\u003ethink of another work of art which captures the experience\\u003c\\u002fbr\\u003eof being (banally) constrained by your own nature so well.\\u003c\\u002fbr\\u003eThe scene plays out with an inevitability which is sad and\\u003c\\u002fbr\\u003efamiliar, but aestheticised and distanced by gaming\\u003c\\u002fbr\\u003econventions. The medium and the subject are combined here in\\u003c\\u002fbr\\u003ea way that could not happen in other narrative forms. And\\u003c\\u002fbr\\u003emost interestingly it leverages features of gaming which\\u003c\\u002fbr\\u003esome have argued make it a poor medium for narrative. It is\\u003c\\u002fbr\\u003ea small part of the game, and a simple idea, but it works\\u003c\\u002fbr\\u003ewith the materiality and constraints of gaming as a medium,\\u003c\\u002fbr\\u003eto articulate an experience quite forcefully.\",\"at the end of the true (fifth) ending, the ending credits\\u003c\\u002fbr\\u003esong flows between english, french, and japanese, and slowly\\u003c\\u002fbr\\u003efades out as a loud hum of people takes the melody, and it\\u003c\\u002fbr\\u003ewas perhaps the last of many times the game struck me as\\u003c\\u002fbr\\u003eart, as it so perfectly closes a game that so perfectly\\u003c\\u002fbr\\u003eimposes and explores questions of human nature in a game\\u003c\\u002fbr\\u003ewith no humans\",\"It was breathtaking to see what a digital playground can\\u003c\\u002fbr\\u003elook like.\",\"The game had a simple linear story structure that allowed\\u003c\\u002fbr\\u003eyou to experience and understand elements of the story at\\u003c\\u002fbr\\u003eyour own pace as you play through the game.
